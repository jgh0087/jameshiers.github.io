## Technical Writing Work

This repository contains an assortment of professional work demonstrating my skills and abilities. The chart below contains a breakdown of the work contained. The intent is to create a single place for various pieces of work to live and it will contain an ever-expanding libaray.

Although it is currently **small,** as I continue through my program I hope to add more to it, both from in-class assignments and from pro bono work.
